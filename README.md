# TrackOnTrakt

Android application for tracking of watched movies and shows on [trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv)  

## Motivation

Main motivation is to develop nontrivial application where I can experiment with some technologies 
and practices I'd like to try. The application can also serve as my personal reference project. 


## Setup

Make copy of keys.properties.example file named keys.properties.
 
### Trakt API key

You'll need to [create a trakt application](https://trakt.tv/oauth/applications/new) and copy 
client id and client secret into the file mentioned above.
